They are produced using low-cost materials and fabrication techniques such as low-temperature solution and vapor-based processing. PSCs have achieved power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) above 25%, which are competitive with traditional inorganic solar cells. The high efficiency of PSCs is due to their excellent light absorption, low recombination rates, and long carrier lifetimes. Perovskite materials offer high structural and compositional tunability, allowing optimization of their optical and electronic properties to improve the efficiency and stability of PSCs.  Our research focuses on the development of deposition routes for perovskite semiconductors, study thin film crystallization and construct efficient solar cells with a focus on material composition and interfaces.\nDespite these advantages, long-term stability remains to be one of critical challenges toward PSC commercialization. In EML, we explore strategies to enhancing the stability of PSCs, including composition engineering of perovskite (e.g., methylammonium-free lead halide perovskites ","[1]",", interface engineering (e.g., PEAI & OABr passivation ","[2]","), and charge transport modification (e.g., vapor phase infiltration ","[3]",").
