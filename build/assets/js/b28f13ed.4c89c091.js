At this stage of their development, the key issues are how to further improve efficiencies and, very importantly, their long-term stability. As photocurrents are near the theoretical maximum, my focus is on the increase in open-circuit voltage by improvements in the charge-selective contacts and in the charge carrier lifetimes in perovskites, e.g., via surface passivation. Perovskite solar cells promise to be revolutionary in the photovoltaic field, but the quest to understand and fix degradation mechanisms needs to be of priority to achieve long-term device stability. A Review on this subject was published in Science on November 10, 2017, including the cover for that edition as seen in the picture to the upper left.
