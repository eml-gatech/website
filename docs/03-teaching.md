# Teaching 

## Philosophy

Students should come out of the classroom with not only theoretical frameworks for problem-solving, but also a practical intuition of advanced concepts that will enable them to develop novel solutions to today’s largest engineering challenges.  I have learned this throughout my academic career, where I have had the privilege of teaching and mentoring at many levels, from secondary education through graduate school. I have taught courses at the high school and undergraduate levels and mentored nine Master’s and PhD students on challenging research projects. My intention as a mentor and a teacher is to continue the path of knowledge dissemination by teaching a method that involves problem-solving of real societal challenges, which will allow the student to develop skill and intuition.

## NSF GK-12 Fellow and High School Teacher

I am committed to promoting ethnic and gender diversity because I believe that groups with different backgrounds enrich the working environment. Cultural, ethnic and gender diversity brings different perspectives which lead to highly creative and competitive environments. I also acknowledge that there is a need to bring minority groups into the STEM fields and this has become a big part of my mission as an academician in the USA. Throughout my academic career, I have dedicated time to empower minority and female students to become part of the academic landscape.

During my time at Hartford High School, I personally coached students in the process of applying to college to pursue careers in STEM.  I believe that role models of different ethnic backgrounds are important in the pursuit of a more diverse higher education system. Some of the students I mentored participated in a NASA-sponsored competition in Huntsville, AL.
