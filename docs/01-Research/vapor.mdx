# Vapor Processing: Evaporation, ALD, and VPI

<img src={i1} align="right" className="research-img"/>

- We use thermal co-evaporation to deposit the perovskite layers with different compositions such as MAPbI<sub>3</sub>, FAPbI<sub>3</sub>, and Cs<sub>x</sub>FA<sub>(1-x)</sub>PbI<sub>3</sub> by carefully controlling the evaporation rate of each individual precursor (i.e. MAI, FAI, CsI, and MAI) 

- Single source and flash evaporation is a way to bypass the calibration of the quartz crystals microbalances (QCM) and simplify the deposition process. Perovskite single crystals with different compositions are prepared beforehand and evaporated in a vacuum chamber. These methods also <br/> allow for shorter deposition times, which is of interest for industry upscaling

- Atomic layer deposition (ALD) allows for the formation uniform perovskite layers with angstrom-level thickness control. This technique is being implemented for the fabrication of perovskite microcavities that show strong light-matter interactions, and the deposition of 2D perovskite to reduce interface recombination in perovskite solar cells (PSC)

- We use vapor phase infiltration (VPI) in collaboration with the group of Professor [Mark Losego](https://www.mse.gatech.edu/people/mark-losego) to improve the stability of organic materials used in PSC by hybridizing them with clusters of metal oxides.<br/> We showed that infiltration of TiO2 into the spiro-OMeTAD layer leads <br/> to an improve of the stability at high temperatures (75°C)

Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have achieved a record efficiency of 25.6% by using spin coating for the deposition of most of the layers involved. Careful control of the phase purity, morphology, and thus optoelectronic properties of the layers has been crucial to achieve these results. However, there are many drawbacks of the spin coating deposition approach, such as low throughput, extensive amounts of toxic solvents, low quality of films near the edges of the substrates, the presence of large defects in the film, and solvent orthogonality. These drawbacks translate into roadblocks for thin film processing in large scale. We study the deposition of energy materials by different vacuum-based deposition techniques to address these concerns.
