- We study the fundamental interactions between light and matter.

- We correlate advanced characterization techniques with optical measurements to understand the role of structure in light-matter interactions.

- We use microcavities to study the Strong Light Matter Coupling Regime, when excitations in the material interact strongly with modes in the <br/> electromagnetic field, to form hybridized half-matter half-light quasiparticles.

Metal-halide perovskites have demonstrated great potential for photonic applications due to their tunable bandgap through compositional change, which allows for light absorption from the ultraviolet to the near infra-red. In quantum photonics, the interactions of light with matter play an essential role in determining the output quantum state of light. However, it is not yet fully explored how the structure of perovskites affects their light-matter interactions.  Our research focuses on understanding the dynamics of light-induced excited states in metal halide perovskites and their dependance on structural properties. By understanding the relationship between the structural properties of perovskites and their light-matter interactions, we aim to design novel photonic devices with improved performance.
